# Introduction

This is a simple and intuitive web application built with React.JS to help users manage and track their daily expenses. The user can add, edit, and delete expenses, track spending by category, view expense summaries, and visualize trends through charts. The wallet balance is automatically updated, and all data persists using localStorage.

### Expense Summary:

### Expense Trends:
